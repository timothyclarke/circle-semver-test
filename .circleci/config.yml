            Promote a commit a semantic version release. It assumes the context of a GitHub pull request, and promotion of the code to a new major/minor/patch version is based on information that must be contained in the subject of the commit that merges the pull request. Namely, the commit subject must include both a ticket reference, and the `[semver:FOO]` pattern, where FOO is major, minor, patch, or skip (to skip promotion). e.g. 'Merge pull request #XX from some-branch JIRA-123 [semver:minor]'
