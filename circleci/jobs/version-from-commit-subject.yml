  Promote a commit a semantic version release.
  It assumes the context of a GitHub pull request, and promotion of
  the code to a new major/minor/patch version is
  based on information that must be contained in the subject of
  the commit that merges the pull request.
  Namely, the commit subject must include both a ticket reference,
  and the `[semver:FOO]` pattern, where FOO is major, minor, patch,
  or skip (to skip promotion).
  e.g. 'Merge pull request #XX from some-branch JIRA-123 [semver:minor]'
